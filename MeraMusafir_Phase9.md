# Phase 9 — Community Feed

**Status:** Complete and verified end to end (includes the Phase 9.5 rich-media pass)
**Goal (from master plan):** *"Living community that keeps users engaged between trips"*

---

## 1. What was built

| Master-plan requirement | Delivered |
|---|---|
| Community posts table, CRUD | `community_posts` + full CRUD with Policy-based authorisation |
| Like system | `post_likes` with a unique constraint; toggle endpoint |
| Comment system | `post_comments` (soft-deleted), list/add/delete |
| Post-to-destination association | Optional `destination_id`; posts render a clickable place tag |
| Moderation flag | `is_flagged` / `is_hidden` on posts and comments; posts reportable via the existing Report system |
| Feed algorithm | `FeedService` — recency + destination relevance + followed agencies/people + engagement |
| Community feed page (infinite scroll) | `CommunityPage.vue`, scroll-triggered pagination |
| Create post (text + image upload) | Inline composer using the Phase 8.5 `ImageUpload` pipeline |
| Post card (image, text, destination tag, like + comment counts) | `PostCard.vue` |
| Destination-specific feed | "From the community" section on the destination detail page |
| Agency post type (styled differently) | Agency posts carry an **AGENCY** badge and link to the storefront |

### Phase 9.5 — rich media & categories (follow-up pass)

| Added | Notes |
|---|---|
| 6 new categories | **Find companions**, Question, Road/weather alert, Gear & packing, Budget, Safety — on top of Story, Tip, Review, Announcement |
| Companion call-to-action | Companion posts show **"I'm interested"**, which opens a DM with the author (respects DM privacy — falls back to a message request) |
| Video posts | Upload + inline playback, `media_type = video` |
| GIF support | Giphy picker (hotlinked, not copied to disk); uploaded `.gif` files pass through **unflattened** so animation survives |
| Music on posts | Royalty-free catalogue (Jamendo) with search + preview; track shown as a tappable pill over the media, like a reel's audio credit |
| Instagram-style UI | Full-bleed media, double-tap-to-like with heart burst, inline `name + caption`, relative timestamps |
| **Share to DM** | Search people by name, multi-select, optional note → the post arrives as a **preview card** in their chat. If the recipient has blocked the post's author it renders as **"Post unavailable"** instead |
| Card layout (revised) | Caption sits directly under the media; actions moved into their **own pill bar** below, with counts and labels |
| Comment styling | Speech-bubble comments with avatars, inline timestamps and a rounded inline composer |

---

## 2. Architecture decisions

**Scoring runs in SQL, not PHP.**
The feed ranks by a computed score. Doing that in PHP would mean loading *every* post to sort them before paginating. The score is built as a SQL expression so MySQL can rank and paginate in one query.

**Score composition** (`app/Services/FeedService.php`):

| Signal | Weight | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Recency | 60 → 0 over ~14 days | Base score. A great old post eventually yields to fresh ones |
| Followed author | +40 | People you chose to follow are the strongest relevance signal |
| Followed agency | +35 | Directly from the brief |
| Destination you've travelled to | +25 | Derived from *joined* trip membership, not stated preferences — actions beat claims |
| Engagement | +2 per like/comment, **capped at 20** | Rewards good posts without letting one viral post dominate forever |

**Counters are denormalised but derived, never incremented.**
`likes_count` / `comments_count` live on the post so the feed can sort on them without a `COUNT` per row. They're recomputed from the underlying rows after every change (`FeedService::syncCounters`) rather than `increment()`-ed. This is deliberate: the agency follower counter used `increment/decrement` and drifted **negative** in Phase 8.5. Deriving the value makes drift structurally impossible.

**Blocked users are filtered at read time**, in both the feed and comment lists, reusing `BlockedUser::relatedIds`.

**Authorisation via Policies**, per the project standards — `CommunityPostPolicy` (author-only edit/delete) and `PostCommentPolicy` (comment author *or* post author can delete, so people can moderate their own threads). Both grant admins blanket access via `before()`. This required adding the `AuthorizesRequests` trait to the base controller, which Laravel 11 ships empty.

## 5. What I verified

Backend (curl) and UI (headless Chromium), all passing with zero console errors:

- Post creation as traveller and as agency; agency posts return `is_agency: true` with the agency name
- Like toggle: `on → off → on`, count stays correct, double-tap can't double-like
- Comment add/list, `comments_count` syncs
- **Authorisation**: a non-author deleting someone else's post → `403`
- **Validation**: empty body → `422` with the custom message
- Anonymous browsing works; `is_liked` is `false` for guests
- Destination filter returns only that destination's posts
- Reporting a post → `201` through the existing Report system
- **Infinite scroll**: 10 posts → 15 on scroll
- Type filter (Tips) returns only `Tip` chips
- Image upload through the composer, and the image renders in the feed
- **Ranking**: following an agency moved its post from **position 4 → position 1**

## 5b. Rich media — how it works

**Media column.** `image` was replaced by `media_url` + `media_type` (`image|video|gif`). The migration copies existing images across and is fully reversible. `media_url` holds either a stored path **or** an external URL — a Giphy GIF is hotlinked rather than copied onto our disk, which is how Giphy is meant to be used and keeps storage small.

**Keys stay server-side.** `/media/gifs` and `/media/music` proxy Giphy and Jamendo from Laravel, so the API keys never reach the browser, and there's one place to cache (10 min), normalise and rate-limit. Both endpoints return `{ configured: false, message }` when a key is absent, and the pickers show that message instead of breaking.

**Why Jamendo and not Spotify/Apple.** Instagram can put commercial music on your reel because Meta licenses it from the labels. Spotify and Apple preview APIs explicitly forbid using clips as background audio for user content. Jamendo is Creative Commons licensed, so the artist and licence come back with each track and the UI credits them.

Spotify was re-evaluated in July 2026 and ruled out again, now on technical grounds as well as licensing. Its `preview_url` — the 30-second MP3 this feature would need — returns `null` for every app registered on or after **27 Nov 2024**, with no key or scope that restores it; real playback requires the Web Playback SDK, which means each *listener* must be signed in with Spotify Premium. A client ID alone is also not enough to call the API at all: `/v1/search` needs a Client Credentials token, which requires the client secret. Don't spend time re-litigating this.

**Video has no transcoding.** There is no FFmpeg in this environment, so uploads are stored as-is: a 4K phone clip stays 4K and every viewer downloads all of it. Capped at 50MB. Production needs a transcoding pipeline and a CDN.

**PHP limits had to be raised.** `upload_max_filesize` defaulted to **2M**, so PHP rejected videos before Laravel ever saw the request. Added `/usr/local/etc/php/8.3/conf.d/zz-meramusafir.ini` (64M upload / 72M post / 256M memory). **Any new machine or server needs the same change** or video uploads fail with a confusing "The file failed to upload."

## 6. Known limitations / deliberate scope cuts

1. ~~**No realtime.**~~ **Done (July 2026).** New posts now push over Reverb. A `PostCreated` event broadcasts a lightweight `{id, author_id}` on a public `community` channel; the open feed counts them into a **"N new posts"** pill and re-fetches on click — so every per-viewer filter (blocks, suspensions, ranking) still runs server-side rather than trusting a broadcast payload. Your own posts and single-post view are ignored. This landed alongside an Echo refactor: chat, notifications and the feed now share **one** Reverb connection (`utils/echo.js`) instead of each store tearing down and recreating `window.Echo`, which had been silently killing each other's channels.
2. ~~**Moderation is data-only.**~~ **Addressed in Phase 11.** The admin Reports queue reviews flagged posts, opens the content, and can dismiss, mark actioned, or **suspend the author** directly. `is_hidden` / `is_flagged` still have no dedicated per-post toggle, but the moderation loop (report → review → action) is closed.
3. **No edit UI.** `PUT` works and is policy-protected, but the frontend only offers delete.
4. **Feed isn't cached.** Deliberate — the Phase 8.5 matching cache served stale results for an hour after a trip changed. Ranking is cheap here; caching can come with proper invalidation later.
5. ~~**`per_page` is unbounded.**~~ **Done (July 2026).** Clamped to `[1, 30]` in `CommunityPostController::index`, so a client can't request an enormous page.
6. Seeded post text is illustrative demo copy, not real user content.
7. GIF and music are **verified live** (Giphy returns 24 results, Jamendo 20). Jamendo's raw search is strict and intermittently empty, so the music picker now ships **curated mood shelves** (Chill, Cinematic, Road trip, Adventure, Acoustic, Desi & world, Calm, Folk) backed by tags checked to return tracks, with a 3× retry to smooth over Jamendo's occasional empty responses.
8. ~~**No poster-frame generation.**~~ **Done (July 2026).** A video's first frame is captured **client-side** (hidden `<video>` → canvas → JPEG) when it's added in the composer, uploaded as an image, and stored as `gallery[].poster`; the feed and composer render it as the `<video poster="…">`, so a video shows a real thumbnail instead of a black rectangle before play. **Transcoding is still not possible here** — there's no FFmpeg in this environment, so a 4K clip stays 4K (capped at 50MB). Production needs a transcoding pipeline and a CDN.
8b. A shared post's preview is **snapshotted** into the message. Editing the post later won't rewrite what was already sent — deliberate, but worth knowing.
9. Music plays through a plain `<audio>` element — it doesn't mix into a video's own soundtrack the way Instagram does.

## 7. Testing checklist

Log in as **test6@test.com** (or any `test1–test6`, password `password`). Agency: **agency1@test.com**.

### Feed basics
1. Open **Community** in the sidebar → feed loads with posts, newest/most relevant first.
2. Posts show author, avatar, time ago, type chip (Story/Tip/Review), and like/comment counts.
3. Posts tagged with a place show a purple **📍 destination** link → clicking it opens that destination.
4. Scroll to the bottom → more posts load automatically; at the end you see *"You're all caught up."*
5. Click **Tips** filter → only Tip posts remain. Click **All** → everything returns.

### Posting
6. Click the composer → it expands to show type, destination and photo fields.
7. Post text only → appears at the top of the feed immediately.
8. Post with a **photo** (drag-drop or click) → preview shows before posting, image renders in the feed.
9. Tag a **destination** and post → the tag appears on the card, and the post shows on that destination's page.
10. Try posting an empty body → the Post button stays disabled.
11. Paste >2000 characters → the field stops at the limit.

### Likes & comments
12. Click the heart → it fills, count increments. Click again → it unfills, count decrements.
13. Reload the page → your like state persisted.
14. Click the comment icon → comments expand.
15. Add a comment → it appears instantly and the count increments.
16. Delete your own comment (✕) → it disappears and the count decrements.
17. On **your own** post, you can delete comments left by others.

### Permissions & safety
18. On someone else's post, the ⋮ menu shows **Report post** (not Delete).
19. On your own post, ⋮ shows **Delete post** → confirm dialog → post disappears.
20. Report a post → "Report submitted" confirmation.
21. Block a user (People → ⋮ → Block), then reload Community → their posts are gone from your feed.
22. Log out and open `/#/community` → you can read the feed, but there's no composer and liking prompts you to log in.

### Agency behaviour
23. Log in as **agency1@test.com** → sidebar has **Community**.
24. Post as the agency → the card has a tinted background, an **AGENCY** badge, and the business name.
25. Click the agency name on the post → opens the storefront (not a user profile).

### Destination feed
26. Open **Explore → Hunza Valley** → scroll to **"From the community"** → only Hunza-tagged posts appear.
27. Like and comment from the destination page → both work inline.
28. Open a destination with no posts → friendly empty state with a link to Community.

### Rich media & categories
31. Open the composer → the category strip scrolls horizontally with 9 options (agencies also see **Announcement**).
32. Pick **Find companions** → the placeholder changes to *"Where are you going, when, and who are you looking for?"*.
33. Post a companion listing → on someone else's account it shows a teal **"I'm interested"** button.
34. Click **I'm interested** → opens a DM with the author. If they restrict DMs, you get the message-request flow instead.
35. Filter by **Companions** → only companion posts remain.
36. Attach a **photo** → preview appears, then renders full-bleed in the feed.
37. Attach a **video** (mp4 under 50MB) → preview has controls, and it plays inline in the feed.
38. **Double-tap** any post's media → a large heart bursts and the post is liked (double-tapping again never *un*likes).
39. Long post → caption truncates with a **more** link.
40. Check `N likes`, `View all N comments` and the uppercase relative timestamp all read correctly.
41. Click **GIF** → without a key you get *"GIF search is not set up yet…"*. With a key, search and pick one; it renders in the feed.
42. Click **Music** → same. With a key, search, press ▶ to preview, pick a track → it appears as a pill over the media; tap the pill to play.

### Ranking (optional, the interesting one)
29. As **test4**, note where the agency's post sits in the feed.
30. Follow **Hunza Explorers** (Agencies → Follow), reload Community → its post ranks noticeably higher.

## 8. Enabling GIFs and music

Both are optional; the app runs fine without them. To turn them on, add free keys to `backend/.env`:

```
GIPHY_KEY=            # https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/  (create app → API key)
JAMENDO_CLIENT_ID=    # https://devportal.jamendo.com/           (register app → client id)
```

Then `php artisan config:clear`. The pickers switch from "not set up yet" to live results — no frontend change needed.

---

## 9. Reproducing the data

```bash
cd backend
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed --class=CommunityPostSeeder   # 12 demo posts, idempotent
```

`CommunityPostSeeder` is in the default `DatabaseSeeder` chain, so `migrate:fresh --seed`
recreates everything. It reuses images already downloaded by `ImageSeeder` — no new
network calls — and skips posts whose body text already exists, so re-running is safe.
